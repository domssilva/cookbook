# Truly understanding the problem domain

the first point of failure is misunderstanding the problem.

1. not understanding what users are trying to accomplish
2. not receiving all requirements

will inevitably retain a bad model of the problem and thus
end up implementing the wrong solution.

the key to designing a god solution to a problem requires
first and foremost a correct and complete model of the problem.

# Enemies of Clean Code

1. Javascript - ubiquitous language
2. Management
  * pressure to ship
  * documentation
  * architecture
  * consistency
  * testing
  * best practices
  * bugginess
  * unhappy users
  * burned-out developers
  * communication: do not over-promise or under-sell problems
3. Self - spiral into a place where we are writing code to impress people 
4. Cargo cult - descripe copying patterns and behaviors without fully understanding their true purpose and functionality

# SOLID and other principles
the world of software is riddled with principles and acronyms.
There are many firm and entrenched ideas about how we should go 
about writing code.

Javascript's ability to accomodate many different paradigms is one
of its strengths as a programming language, but it can also make
our job harder.

It's up to javascript programmers to implement their own paradigms.

* Law of Demeter *LoD*
* SOLID
* abstraction principle
* functional programming principles

# Naming things is hard
names are the our mind's way of abstracting the complexity
of the universe. In the world of software, we are always engaged in crafting new abstractions
to describe our everyday realities.

names should have:
1. purpose
2. concept
3. contract
6. consistency
